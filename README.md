# Agriculture Company

An agriculture company operates systems for growing, processing, distribution, fleet
inherited through mergers. Data is isolated in silos, limiting insights and optimization.
Inventory management and distribution coordination is challenging.

The fragmented systems restrict the company's ability to make data-driven decisions across
the agriculture value chain. For example, cultivation plans are based on isolated data rather
than insights from downstream supply chain, inventory, and sales data. This results in over
or under production and inefficient distribution. The company needs to share data across
the seed-to-shelf process to boost yields, reduce waste and costs.

The solution would identify microservices aligned to agriculture capabilities like cultivation
management and inventory. These would expose relevant farming and inventory data via
APIs managed by a gateway. This data is streamed to a cloud analytics platform for AI
optimization. This approach incrementally decomposes siloed systems over time into
focused, decoupled services that deliver unified data access through managed APIs.
